        <h1>Training Your Own Service Dog</h1>
        <!---paragraph-->
        <p class ="IntroP">So you’ve researched it, talked about it and tried to convince yourself otherwise, but despite all your efforts, you still think that getting service dog might be the best thing that will ever happen to you. Well you are not alone, and in fact so many people are in need of a furry life changer that waiting time can range from one to three years depending on the severity of your disability. For those of us that feel as if that is way too long or don’t have an organization providing the right type of service dog, the next best thing to do is train your own ...but for us who aren’t professional dog trainers or have never even had a dog..what do you do? The internet may sometimes be a great place to look, but sometimes despite all of the people using, it lacks information in certain areas, especially for disabilities and on those embarking on the voyage of training their own service dog. That’s why I have compiled a list of steps and info from all over to make your journey easier.</p>

        <h2>Choosing the Right Dog</h2>
        <p>Many organizations and people chose to get their pups from a breeder to ensure the right characteristics. Others prefer to give a qualified shelter pup a second chance. This choice depends on your preference, but be aware that the dog must have the correct temperament and eagerness to please, despite their  pedigree.</p>
        <h4>If you choose to get your dog from a breeder, you may want to look into these breeds. Be sure to do more research on the specific breed to find if they fit into your lifestyle (think energy level and exercise)</h4>
